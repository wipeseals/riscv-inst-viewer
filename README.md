[![Deploy static content to Pages](https://github.com/wipeseals/riscv-inst-viewer/actions/workflows/static.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/wipeseals/riscv-inst-viewer/actions/workflows/static.yml)

A RISC-V instruction set visualization and analysis tool to support RISC-V development and debugging. Provides instruction listing and numerical decoding functionality to streamline processor development and assembly programming workflows.

ðŸš€ **Demo Site**: <https://wipeseals.github.io/riscv-inst-viewer/>

## Features

- **Instruction Listing**: Comprehensive display of RISC-V extension instruction sets (RV32I/RV64I, M, A, F, D, C, Zicsr, etc.)
- **Instruction Decoding**: Reverse lookup and decoding of RISC-V instructions from 32-bit numerical values
- **Architecture Support**: Compatible with both RV32 and RV64 architectures
- **Format Visualization**: Visual display of instruction encoding formats (R-type, I-type, S-type, etc.)
- **Standalone Operation**: Executable as a single HTML file with no external dependencies
- **Responsive Design**: Compatible with both desktop and mobile environments
- **Dark Mode**: Light/dark theme switching support

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Search for instruction names in the "Search Instructions" section, or enter hexadecimal values in the "32-bit Instruction Decoder"
3. View detailed instruction information and encoding
